\section{Proposals}
	\experience{Bayesian ML for Assurance Case Evaluation in Complex Systems}{Systems and Technology Research}
		{Dr. Steven Jilcott}{July 2018 - Present}
		{\begin{itemize-noindent}
			\item{\textit{Description.} Bayesian machine learning framework to automate safety assurance processes for complex, modular systems.}
			\item{\textit{Role.} Contributed many of the main ideas of the proposal.}
			\item{\textit{Outcome.} Won 5.8 million dollar contract.}
	\end{itemize-noindent}}

\section{Selected Projects}

	\experience{Group Dynamics Modeling, Forecasting, and Validation}{Systems and Technology Research}
		{Dr. Kirill Trapeznikov}{September 2017 - Present}
		{\begin{itemize-noindent}
			\item{\textit{Research goal.} Investigate behavior of indivduals in group contexts on social media websites. Develop predictive models of group membership.}
			\item{\textit{Role.} Primary technical contributor. Independently read papers, propose research directions, preprocess data, implement, train, and tune models, evaluate and present results.}
			\item{\textit{Approach.} Inspired by recommender systems, formulate problem as matrix factorization. Learn latent factor matrices pointwise. To regularize, constrain model to learn distribution of associated unstructured data. Engineer pipeline to yield reproducible experiments despite nondeterminic preprocessing. Bayesian optimization efficiently tunes highly sensitive hyperparameters.}
			\item{\textit{Results.} Ongoing. Models reliably outperform baselines. Regularization with unstructured data boosts performance overall, but unevenly across users. }
		\end{itemize-noindent}}

	\experience{Synchronized Plans and Analytics for aiR-Cyber-Space (SPARCS)}{Systems and Technology Research}
		{Mr. Nick Pioch}{September 2017 - September 2018}
		{\begin{itemize-noindent}
			\item{\textit{Research goal.} Database alignment. Build model to automatically align schemas from disparate databases.}
			\item{\textit{Role.} Lead analyst. Implemented, trained models both collaboratively and independently.}
			\item{\textit{Approach.} Draw ideas from knowledge base completion literature. Train neural network to infer facts about entities at the ontological (schema) level.}
			\item{\textit{Results.} Schemas of sufficient size required to obtain reasonable results. Model correctly infers unobserved ontological facts when trained against large schemas with some explicit overlap.}
		\end{itemize-noindent}}

	\experience{AlphaGo Replication}{DSC 531 Data Science Practicuum}
		{Dr. Henry Kautz}{January 2016 - May 2016}
		{\begin{itemize-noindent}
			\item{\textit{Research goal.} Build open-source implementation of AlphaGo.}
			\item{\textit{Role.} Sole undergraduate student. Independently built initial prototype of the four deep nets in AlphaGo system. Implemented Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) rollouts with a partner. Helped lead group discussions to resolve apparent implementation inconsistencies.}
			\item{\textit{Approach.} Study paper closely, understand implementation in sufficient detail to reconstruct it.}
			\item{\textit{Results.} Many individual components finished (models, rollouts, game simulator, etc). Overall implementation incomplete due to insufficient time and compute resources. Broadly useful effort nevertheless; Github repository forked several thousand times, still under active development.}
		\end{itemize-noindent}}

	\experience{Online Interpretations of Scalar Adjectives}{BCS 206 Undergraduate Research in Cognitive Science}
		{Dr. Chigusa Kurumada}{September 2015 - May 2016}
		{\begin{itemize-noindent}
			\item{\textit{Research question.} In discourse, people integrate context with speaker utterances to resolve their meaning. Two opposing theories about the mechanism behind this process: One holds that people rely on fixed rules to accomplish contextual integration, the other that the mechanism flexibly adapts to specific situations.}
			\item{\textit{Role.} Team member, programmer. Independently analyzed experimental data, from raw eyetracking time series to hypothesis testing. Presented results with team.}
			\item{\textit{Approach.} Conceptual replication of The Effect of Speaker-Specific Information on Pragmatic Inferences (Grodner and Sedivy, 2011). Eyetracking study with 40 subjects. Control group hears instructions from normal speaker, experimental group from speaker who overcontextualizes. Hypothesis: Control group integrates context, while experimental group learns to disregard it.}
			\item{\textit{Results.} Hypothesis confirmed, supporting theory of adaptable contextual integration. Possible flaw discovered in reference experiment; they did not report interaction significance for a within-subject factor.}
		\end{itemize-noindent}}
